One possible explanation is that females may travel in larger groups, increasing their likelihood of crossing, whereas males are more solitary and potentially less bold. Further investigation is needed to better understand these behavioral patterns.\n\n\nFigure 1: Differences in Road Crossings\n\nSexTime of DaySeason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Guanaco data collection occurred October 2019 through November 2021.\n\n\n\nAverage Movement\n\n\n\nMLG06: Average Movement, Female\n\n\nTrapped\n\n\n\nMLG08: Trapped, Female\n10 of the 4668 interactions were classified as “Quick Cross”, meaning that only 10 of the 116 highway crosses took place within 2 hours of being 80 meters from the highway.\n\n\nGuanaco Behavioral Responses\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics with Highway as Barrier\n\n\nInteraction Type\nNumber of Interactions\nShare of Interactions\nShare Leading to Cross\n\n\n\n\nAverage Movement\n971\n20.8%\n5.1%\n\n\nTrapped\n1,802\n38.6%\n0.4%\n\n\nBounce\n1,051\n22.5%\n0.0%\n\n\nQuick Cross\n10\n0.2%\n100.0%",

    "text": "Model Results\nTo test whether guanacos avoid crossing the highway due to traffic, I created two interaction variables combining the highway and visitor roads with a daytime binary variable. The coefficients on these interaction terms capture the additional impact of crossing busy roads, using daytime as a proxy for higher traffic.\nWhen these interactions are included, we find that guanacos are 7.4% ± 1.6% (p &lt; 0.05) and 7.7% ± 1.7% (p &lt; 0.05; see Appendix Table 2) less likely to cross the highway and visitor road, respectively, beyond the baseline likelihood of crossing during the day. This reduction is likely attributable to traffic-related avoidance or increased perceived risk. Notably, this model is the most explanatory, as it has the lowest AIC value among those tested.\n\nModel Comparison (AIC Values)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy results indicated that paved roads significantly affect guanaco movement, with vehicular traffic being a major contributing factor. However, other factors may also influence highway avoidance, including differences in vegetation and habitat on either side of the road, as well as fear of poaching, since private land borders the highway. Future research should investigate these alternative hypotheses and the potential role of fencing.\n\n\nRegression Table\n\n\nFrom a conservation perspective, these findings highlight that roadways can fragment guanaco habitat. When planning new national parks or conservation areas, park managers should consider connectivity across roads. Strategies such as wildlife crossing structures could help mitigate the negative effects of traffic and maintain mobility for guanaco populations.",
