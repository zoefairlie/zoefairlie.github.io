One possible explanation is that females may travel in larger groups, increasing their likelihood of crossing, whereas males are more solitary and potentially less bold. Further investigation is needed to better understand these behavioral patterns.\n\n\nFigure 1: Differences in Road Crossings\n\nSexTime of DaySeason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Guanaco data collection occurred October 2019 through November 2021.",

    "text": "Model Results\nTo test whether guanacos avoid crossing the highway due to traffic, I created two interaction variables combining the highway and visitor roads with a daytime binary variable. The coefficients on these interaction terms capture the additional impact of crossing busy roads, using daytime as a proxy for higher traffic.\nWhen these interactions are included, we find that guanacos are 7.4% and 7.7% less likely to cross the highway and visitor road, respectively, beyond the baseline likelihood of crossing during the day. This reduction is likely attributable to traffic-related avoidance or increased perceived risk. Notably, this model is the most explanatory, as it has the lowest AIC value among those tested.\n\nModel Comparison (AIC Values)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy results indicated that paved roads significantly affect guanaco movement, with vehicular traffic being a major contributing factor. However, other factors may also influence highway avoidance, including differences in vegetation and habitat on either side of the road, as well as fear of poaching, since private land borders the highway. Future research should investigate these alternative hypotheses and the potential role of fencing.\n\n\nRegression Table\n\n\nThis study builds on the idea that roads affect guanacos use of space negatively by finding a mechanistic answer: guanacos fear traffic. I can conclude that guanacos do not exhibit fear from being close to roads, but the road acts as a barrier for crossing.\nThis has huge conservation implications since roads may lead to spatial segregation and isolation of guanaco populations. In North America and Europe, we have seen the creation of wildlife tunnels and bridges for animals crossing major roads, and this could be a potential mitigation technique in South America. Strategies such as these allow for increased permeability of an otherwise uncrossable barrier.\nThe Patagonian steppe is considered a high priority location for global conservation due to habitat fragmentation. There are currently lots of efforts to restore guanaco habitat. Organizations such as Tompkins Conservation (also known as Rewilding Patagonia) have been taking actions, such as buying and setting aside conservation tracts, to help protect habitat and species, since much of the area has become farmland. Another strategy for guanaco conservation is reintroducing guanacos throughout Argentina. When deciding locations of conservation tracts or where to release guanacos it is important to consider their mobility. All these conservation approaches will require huge investments so it is crucial to assess if roads in the area will limit guanacos’ ability to move between parks or conservation tracts.",
