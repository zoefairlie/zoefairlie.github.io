    "text": "Example Guanaco Movement\n\n\n\nMLG06: Female, 113 kg\nTo analyze guanacos’ interaction with the barrier we used Barrier Behavior Analysis (BaBA) which is a spatial analysis package that classifies barrier interaction types and collects barrier crossing data.\nI found that 29.3% of highway crossing events were by male guanacos (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that females were more likely to cross. Additionally, 66.4% of highway crossings occurred during the summer months (p &lt; 0.05), and 64.7% occurred during daytime. These results contrast with my initial prediction that female guanacos would be less likely to cross the highway. One possible explanation is that females may travel in larger groups, increasing their likelihood of crossing, whereas males are more solitary and potentially less bold. Further investigation is needed to better understand these behavioral patterns.",

The coefficients on these interaction terms capture the additional impact of crossing busy roads, using daytime as a proxy for higher traffic. When these interactions are included, we find that guanacos are 7.4% ± 1.6% (p &lt; 0.05) and 7.7% ± 1.7% (p &lt; 0.05; see Appendix Table 2) less likely to cross the highway and visitor road, respectively, beyond the baseline likelihood of crossing during the day. This reduction is likely attributable to traffic-related avoidance or increased perceived risk. Notably, this model is the most explanatory, as it has the lowest AIC value among those tested.",

However, other factors may also influence highway avoidance, including differences in vegetation and habitat on either side of the road, as well as fear of poaching, since private land borders the highway. Future research should investigate these alternative hypotheses and the potential role of fencing. From a conservation perspective, these findings highlight that roadways can fragment guanaco habitat. When planning new national parks or conservation areas, park managers should consider connectivity across roads. Strategies such as wildlife crossing structures could help mitigate the negative effects of traffic and maintain mobility for guanaco populations.",
