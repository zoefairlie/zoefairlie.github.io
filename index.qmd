I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2022 with a double major in Environmental Economics & Policy and Conservation & Resource Studies along with a minor in Data Science. I worked with the Middleton Lab on my senior honors thesis - using GPS collar data to study guanacos interactions with roadways in Patagonia. 

Since graduating from Berkeley, I worked for 2 years as an RA at The Brattle Group, a litigation consulting firm. 

Currently, I work as an Senior RA at ECO Northwest on the Data Analytics team in the Seattle office.
